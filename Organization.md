## Paper Reviews

Most work in this class consists of reading research papers. We will cover one paper per week. For each paper, you are required to write a review.

#### Content
A review should start with a short, neutral summary of the paper (1-2 paragraphs), followed by a list of paper's main contributions/insights, and a list of its limitations. Finally, answer specific questions posted for this paper on the syllabus page (if any). Our goal is to get you to think deeply and critically about the paper, not to test you. You won’t be graded on the correctness of your reviews; any non-trivial review will get you 5%.

#### Logistics
The reviews are due every **Wednesday** by the end of the day. Links to papers will be posted in the [[Syllabus]] at least one week before the review due date.

The reviews must be submitted through the EasyChair conference management system. You will receive a Program Committee invitation from the system once you sign up for the course. To be able to submit reviews through EasyChair, you have to associate your EasyChair account with the email address used for the Program Committee invitation (@ucsd.edu instead of @eng.ucsd.edu). You will then be able to login as "PC member" instead of "Author" and see your review assignment under "Review -> My Papers". 

## Final Project

The goal of the project is to gain an in-depth understanding of the techniques presented in the course by re-implementing them, applying them to a new domain, or extending them. A list of possible project topics is available [[here|Project Ideas]]. You can also suggest your own project, pending instructor approval. If you are already working on a research project that fits the theme of this course, feel free to use this as your final project (but please let us know). If you are taking another 291, feel free to propose a single cross-project for both courses.

Projects are expected to be done either **individually or in groups of two**. The scope of the project should be commensurate with the size of the team and whether this is a cross-project for multiple courses. 

There will be four **milestones** throughout the quarter:
* By the first milestone, inform us who is your teammate or if you plan to work individually
* The second milestone is a *project proposal* where you explain what you plan to do and why you think it’s a good idea. You should elaborate on the following: what are you proposing to do, why is it interesting or important, what  are the expected challenges, how does it relate to the state of the art, what evidence do you have so far to suggest this may work. It is expected that for this milestone you will have already done some work towards the project, so we encourage you to come talk to us about your project ideas a couple of weeks before the second milestone.
* The third milestone is a short *presentation* describing your project; the exact length of the presentations will depend on the number of projects that are submitted. 
* At the end of the quarter, you are expected to submit a *final report* describing your project. The report should be 3-5 pages in length in the PACM PL format (follow formatting requirements from this [call for papers](https://popl19.sigplan.org/track/POPL-2019-Research-Papers#POPL-2019-Call-for-Papers)). The report should read like a short paper, so it should make it clear what you did, why you did it, and what you learned from doing it.

Overall, projects will be judged in terms of quality of execution, originality and scope.
