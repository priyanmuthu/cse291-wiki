**Sep 21:** Nadia is traveling during Week 0, so there is **no lecture** on Sep 27. The first lecture will be on October 2.

## 2017

**Oct 1:** To be able to submit reviews through EasyChair, you have to associate your EasyChair account with the email address used for the Program Committee invitation (@ucsd.edu instead of @eng.ucsd.edu). You will then be able to login as "PC member" instead of "Author" and see your review assignment under "Review -> My Papers". 

**Sep 30:** Project teams are recorded on the `CSE291D-Projects` spreadsheet located inside the shared Google Drive folder (if you haven't received an invitation to the shared folder, please email Nadia). Once you have formed a team, fill in the `Team ID` column for all team members with the next free ID (displayed for your convenience at the bottom of the `Team ID` column).

**Sep 30:** You can use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/nadia-polikarpova/cse291-program-synthesis/issues) for all kinds of class-related discussion, including finding team members for your project. Please don't forget to *watch* this repository, so that you get notifications about new issues (you will need a github account).
